1
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
The late fourth century A.D. the 
Roman Empire began to crumble.

2
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt,
still retained some of its lustre,...

3
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
...possessed one of the Seven 
Wonders of the ancient world:...

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,200
...the legendary lighthouse, 
and the biggest library known.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,800
The library was a not only 
cultural but a religious symbol,...

6
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,800
a place where the pagans worshiped 
their ancestral gods.

7
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,400
The traditional pagan worship 
in the city now coexisted...

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,900
...with the Jews, and an unstoppable 
religion up to now banned,...

9
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,900
...Christianity.

10
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.

11
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:20,900
After taking the library, many 
pagans were converted...

12
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:23,900
Hipatia continued teaching and 
researching,...

13
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
...while his former students held...

14
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,900
...important positions in the 
social elite.

15
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,900
The empire was split in two forever.

16
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,900
Many Christians saw this as a 
sign of the end of the world...

17
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,900
...and decided to prepare by 
practicing a more holy life.

18
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,400
The order of "Parabolanos" monks 
was charged to go...

19
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,900
...through the streets and watch
for Christian morality...

20
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:50,000
...now uneven by the presence
of the Jews.

21
00:56:55,400 --> 00:01:21,400
The Library, years later.

22
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,000
How many fools
have wondered 

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,700
why not the stars fall
from the sky 

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
<i> But you,
not happy to cease of the wise, </i>

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,300
<i> You know that the stars
do not move up or down. </i>

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
only reborn <i>
from east to west, </i>

27
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,500
<i> following the most perfect post
ever can see , </i>

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,300
<i> circle. </i>

29
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,900
Because the circle <i> reigns 
in heaven, </i>

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,200
<i> the stars would never have fallen
and never will. </i>

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,000
But what about here on Earth?

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,900
Here, bodies do fall.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,100
But their movements
are not circular but linear.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,500
Look again.

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,400
Again.

36
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
No, leave it.

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,700
So,

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
<i> What mysterious wonder 
do you would think </i>

39
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,000
<i> that may lurk beneath the earth
for every single person and animal, </i>

40
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,900
<i> and object and all laid exact
on there</i>

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
What may should be?

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,400
The highness, madame.

43
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,700
No.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,300
Sinesio.

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,900
The weighty.

46
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,000
<i> No, you both speaking about the same thing,
but you not talking about primary course. </i>

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Has anyone ever thought about
your..

48
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,700
your feet ...

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
your feet

50
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,400
<i> standing perched on the
very center of the cosmos </i>

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,200
that holds all things together,
pull them together

52
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,200
If there is no center,
the universe would be

53
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,200
deformed, infinite, formless,

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
<i> chaotic. </i>

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,200
Doesn't matter that we were <i>
here, there or anywhere </i>

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,600
What you will do? That's right
never being born

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Library of Alexandria 391 AD

58
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
God, Our Father,

59
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
lord of the universe,

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,200
origin of all things,

61
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
eternal force of the cosmos,

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,100
where everything has
its beginning and its end.

63
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,900
Mighty Serapis,
Isis, Horus,

64
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,600
And all the gods Anubis
that protect us

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,100
both in heaven
and on earth ...

66
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,700
Something happens in the market.

67
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,100
I know you also feel something.
I've seen.

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,100
Tell the master that we leave.

69
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Can you believe. He was counting me
as the part of their conquests

70
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,200
This Orestes also foolish
as his father.

71
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,200
I have already suggested that you take
his heart to another muse

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,900
one more beautiful than me.

73
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,200
- Who?
The music.

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,200
<i> Music </i>

75
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,500
He find his music.

76
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
What happen 227 had become 
16 ?

77
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Divide  with 14.

78
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,900
<i> They behave like humans!
Eat, drink and fornicate! </i>

79
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,000
If my gods <i> eat, drink
and fornicate, good for them </i>

80
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Know this,

81
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,700
you who console yourself
with pagan images.

82
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,600
Men, women,
birds, reptiles!

83
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,400
Serapis!

84
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,100
Serapis! Who could trust
the God, need a flower pot

85
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,000
for crown?

86
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,300
Hey You, Christians, how arrogant you 
to take another

87
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,800
Empire attitude like this

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,700
My father's father saw them

89
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,800
slaughtered at the circus

90
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,500
and ate to the lions.

91
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,100
Enough! Watch.

92
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,000
Watch.

93
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,800
You see now 
I walk cross the fire.

94
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,300
If my god ...

95
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,400
If my God is the true god,
I unscathed, no hurt.

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
And if your gods exist,

97
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
<i> they'll roast me like a pig. </i>

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,100
You ...

99
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,300
You're lie!

100
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,900
You'll burn!

101
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
You will have what you deserve!

102
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,400
Let's see if you can walk cross
the fire.

103
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,200
What are you doing?

104
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,000
<i> Stop, you can not do that!
Leave him alone. </i>

105
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,500
<i> Quiet! or you will follow. </i>

106
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,300
Who is this?

107
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,500
Who is this?

108
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,000
How many times should I
must repeat message?

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Today,

110
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
Christians
burn a man.

111
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Right in the middle of agora!

112
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,200
I will not have this in my house!

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,700
Not in the house of Theon!

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,300
Give it to me.

115
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,400
Give it to me!

116
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,900
No terrific mercy is way go

117
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,100
- Davo!
Get up.

118
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,200
You have nothing to do
with this.

119
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,700
I do, i am a Christian.

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,200
<i> What did you say? </i>

121
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,200
I do. I am a Christian
Punish both of us.

122
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,800
So, now we'll presume to teach
us a mercy

123
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Get a whip.
- Father!

124
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,300
Calm ...

125
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Father, I beg you.
I begged you

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,300
wrapped in.. in blazing, right?

127
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,400
To the flames, stupid.

128
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,800
<i> Why did not you burned like the heathen?
Tell me. </i>

129
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,600
Leave us ...

130
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Come here.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
Kneel.

132
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,700
<i> Tell me, is true
you are a Christian? </i>

133
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,900
I do not know what to say, madame.
- Why not?

134
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,400
If i say yes, that will be a lie

135
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,300
If I said no, i lied to
my master and I do not know which is worse.

136
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,300
Then say nothing.

137
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,800
That's it.

138
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,200
Thank you.

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,400
<i> The master is very angry
himself. </i>

140
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,000
What is that?

141
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,900
Something I've done.

142
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,100
<i> looks like a ...</i>

143
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,900
What is it?

144
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
<i> the Ptolemaic system. </i>

145
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,400
Yes it is.

146
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,100
Have you done?

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Earth

148
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,300
is the center of the cosmos

149
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,700
and revolve around

150
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
the sun

151
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,200
and the five wanderers: Mercury,
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.

152
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,800
Never disobeying
the law of the circle.Never

153
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,400
Ptolemy
told me show as do obey.

154
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,800
affected if you see them move

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
<i> in a loop </i>

156
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,500
<i> is the Join effect of
two circles. </i>

157
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,100
One

158
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,700
travel around the Earth

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,200
and the smaller circle

160
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,300
<i> own each wandering. </i>

161
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,900
Loop, the epicycles
"say you see is not happen on the earth"

162
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,600
but our eyes
deceive us.

163
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,700
Well search, Davo.

164
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I like you do the explanation search even 
paying course attention or not

165
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,600
One or two..up here

166
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,800
I tell you The Gods should consulted
to me before they creating anything.

167
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,900
Why say that?

168
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
<i> It's all so whimsical! </i>

169
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,300
Why is the joint take of
two circles?

170
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,000
Would not be more, perfect
if the wander is..

171
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
if wander and a single circle
give sense to everything?

172
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,300
What authority do you judge
the work of God?

173
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,700
What is wrong with you, Christians?

174
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,100
The man is no longer with brief mouth
in this city

175
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,800
Could you decide creation, you could decide
a Lord, 

176
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
and you offended.
You should move to the desert.

177
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
You will not hear anything offensive there.

178
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,800
You know nothing about you speak.
None of you.

179
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,500
What this.. you can explain to all?

180
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,800
What is the question?

181
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,400
Just.. answer me.

182
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,000
<i> If ...</i>

183
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,200
<i> if two things are equal
a third thing, </i>

184
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
and They are all equal to each other

185
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,900
Well.

186
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,100
Now, Are you are not similar to me?

187
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,900
Yes

188
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,600
And you, Orestes?

189
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,900
Yes

190
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,100
Now I am actually say with everybody 
here in this room, 

191
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,300
More things you joint us 

192
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,300
and divide us.

193
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,800
<i> Whatever happens on the street,
we are brothers. </i>

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,300
We are brothers.

195
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Did you remember, the fights are a thing
of slaves and rabble.

196
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Now We should give Davo's presentation
well applause

197
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,900
We will judge all
a live and dead!

198
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,200
And then it will be too late,

199
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,100
because only those who believed in Jesus
